# Chitin implementations

Chitin is language-independent, but at this time only a Go library
exists.

`go get chitin.io/chitin`

**TODO make that real**

Please do start a project for your favorite language and we will list
it here -- just file an issue at our Github project (**TODO link**). We
ask that you do not grab the name `chitin` in any centralized package
registries without coordinating first.  `acmecorp.chitin` is fine.
