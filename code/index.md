# Chitin implementations

Chitin is language-independent, but at this time only a Go library
exists.

`go get chitin.io/chitin`

Please do start a project for your favorite language and we will list
it here -- just file an issue at
[our Github project](https://github.com/chitin-io/web/). We ask that
you do not grab the name `chitin` in any centralized package
registries without coordinating first. `acmecorp.chitin` is fine.
