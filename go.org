* use https://github.com/dchest/varuint
* new object creation via Go structs, avoid setter noise
* mutation via overlay
- go WriteTo & Bytes
- setters & bit flags what's set
* mutation via Go struct & don't change zero fields?
* custom types via constructors that take *[n]byte or []byte
- MarshalBinary or such to go other way around
* dynamic fields can be cached or not
* code generation based on a language-specific, project-specific, config file
- can e.g. choose what dynamic fields are cached
